# drum-kit site/app
A simple javascript drum kit app created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript listens for user keyboard entries and plays various drum sounds depending on which keys were pressed. User feedback is given upon pressing the appropriate keys.

Feel free to review code and make your own! Remember to add your own twist to your own design.
For the audio files, I simply downloaded MP3's and hosted them on a server. I highly recomment you be creating and download the sounds you like!
